        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am an aspiring project manager who values both introspection and ambition. My career goals center on leading impactful projects,
             fostering collaboration, and delivering results that make a tangible difference. 
             I thrive in environments where strategic thinking, clear communication, and creative problem-solving 
             are key-skills, which I believe it align seamlessly with the demands of project management. <br> 
             While stability 
             and security are important to me, I also embrace new challenges, continually seeking opportunities to learn, 
             grow, and contribute meaningfully. <br><br>
             Outside of work, I find joy in quiet moments of reflection and creativity. I cherish my time with 
             close friends and family but equally appreciate solitude, using it to recharge and gain fresh 
             perspectives. My admiration for cats, particularly their blend of independence and genuine 
             warmth, mirrors my own approach to relationship-building and problem-solving. This balanced 
             mindset helps me remain focused, empathetic, and solution-oriented, qualities that bolster my 
             effectiveness as a project manager or coordinator. <br><br>Above all, I aim to create lasting value in 
             every sphere of my life, channeling my passions into driving successful outcomes for the teams and 
             organizations I serve.

                    During my three-year tenure at Amazon, I progressed from a Chargeback Analyst to a Fraud Analyst and ultimately
                     a Project Coordinator. This journey not only expanded my analytical capabilities but also deepened my 
                     appreciation for collaborative, people-focused work. Initially, I spearheaded fraud detection and prevention 
                     strategies, maintaining strict compliance with regulatory standards. I identified high-risk accounts, 
                     achieving a 20% reduction in bad debt exposure and significantly improving operational efficiency. <br><br>

                    As I transitioned into more advanced roles, I took on greater responsibility in coordinating projects
                     and aligning cross-functional teams. This experience enhanced my leadership skills and reinforced 
                     the value of open communication and creative problem-solving. I enjoyed forming genuine connections 
                     with my colleagues, learning from their insights, and sharing my own experiences to build a supportive 
                     environment. My time at Amazon taught me to balance analytical rigor with a collaborative mindset,an approach
                      I’ve carried forward into every subsequent endeavor.

        <p>
            I’ve built a versatile skill set through both hands-on experience and formal education, blending technical 
            capabilities with proven leadership qualities. My time at Amazon allowed me to hone my data analysis skills 
            using SQL and Microsoft Office tools for fraud detection and prevention, as well as developing a keen eye for 
            stakeholder management and strategic planning. Simultaneously, I worked particularly with Excel, Google Sheets 
            and Teams to streamline project workflows and track real-time data. <br><br>
            I’ve complemented these experiences with coursework from my MSc in Project Management, where I delved into 
            Agile and Waterfall methodologies, risk assessment, and advanced project planning. In parallel, 
            I’ve cultivated front-end knowledge in HTML and CSS, as well as expertise in Power BI for robust data visualization 
            and reporting. Whether I’m coordinating cross-functional teams or refining time management protocols, I aim to 
            integrate technical fluency with a people-focused approach to drive innovation, efficiency, and measurable impact 
            in every project I undertake.

        <h2>Education</h2>
        
        <p><b>Growing Passion for Project Management</b> <br>
            While working as a Project Coordinator at Amazon, I discovered my passion for project management through
             direct exposure to planning, coordination, and problem-solving. Mentored by seasoned professionals,
              I observed how structured methodologies, effective risk management, and clear communication 
              could dramatically enhance team performance. Whether it was assigning tasks, monitoring progress, 
              or aligning cross-functional teams, I saw firsthand the transformative impact of well-organized 
              project workflows. This experience not only honed my analytical and leadership skills but also sparked 
              a desire to deepen my understanding of project management principles. <br><br>

              Motivated by these insights, I pursued an MSc in Project Management at the University of Sussex. 
              Through coursework in <b>Managing Innovation</b>, <b>Project Design Thinking</b>, and <b>Advanced Project Management</b>, 
              I learned how to bring creativity and structure to complex initiatives. <br><br>

              As I delved into modules further, I experienced a sort of “reverse effect”. The real-world lessons I had picked 
              up at Amazon suddenly made the theoretical frameworks come alive. Through this blend of professional experience 
              and formal study, my commitment to leading impactful projects solidified and it  fueled my determination to 
              fully absorb the academic side of project management, from risk assessment to innovation strategies. It also 
              strengthened my resolve to apply these insights in tangible ways. <br><br>

              I left the program equipped with a robust toolkit of strategies and frameworks, eager to apply them in real-world
               settings and continue delivering meaningful, efficient results in any project environment. <br><br>

        <h2>Certifications</h2>
        <p>
            I am currently pursuing my PRINCE2 Foundation Certification, refining my structured project management 
            approach and ensuring that I stay abreast of best practices. In tandem, I actively draw on the insights 
            I gained from Managing Project Stakeholders (LinkedIn Learning) and SQL for Data Analysis (Udemy), 
            applying this knowledge to optimize stakeholder engagement and data-driven decision-making. <br><br>
            I am always looking to take on new challenges and partner with forward-thinking organizations committed 
            to innovation and continuous improvement. If you’re seeking a dedicated professional who combines analytical 
            rigor with a people-centered mindset, I would love to connect and explore how I can contribute to your 
            team’s success.
