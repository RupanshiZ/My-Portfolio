        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am an aspiring project manager who values both introspection and ambition. My career goals center on leading impactful projects,
             fostering collaboration, and delivering results that make a tangible difference. 
             I thrive in environments where strategic thinking, clear communication, and creative problem-solving 
             are key-skills I believe align seamlessly with the demands of project management. <br> 
             While stability 
             and security are important to me, I also embrace new challenges, continually seeking opportunities to learn, 
             grow, and contribute meaningfully. <br><br>
             Outside of work, I find joy in quiet moments of reflection and creativity. I cherish my time with 
             close friends and family but equally appreciate solitude, using it to recharge and gain fresh 
             perspectives. My admiration for cats, particularly their blend of independence and genuine 
             warmth—mirrors my own approach to relationship-building and problem-solving. This balanced 
             mindset helps me remain focused, empathetic, and solution-oriented, qualities that bolster my 
             effectiveness as a project manager or coordinator. <br><br>Above all, I aim to create lasting value in 
             every sphere of my life, channeling my passions into driving successful outcomes for the teams and 
             organizations I serve.

                <p>
                    During my three-year tenure at Amazon, I progressed from a Chargeback Analyst to a Fraud Analyst and ultimately
                     a Project Coordinator. This journey not only expanded my analytical capabilities but also deepened my 
                     appreciation for collaborative, people-focused work. Initially, I spearheaded fraud detection and prevention 
                     strategies, maintaining strict compliance with regulatory standards. I identified high-risk accounts, 
                     achieving a 20% reduction in bad debt exposure and significantly improving operational efficiency. <br><br>

                    As I transitioned into more advanced roles, I took on greater responsibility in coordinating projects
                     and aligning cross-functional teams. This experience enhanced my leadership skills and reinforced 
                     the value of open communication and creative problem-solving. I enjoyed forming genuine connections 
                     with my colleagues, learning from their insights, and sharing my own experiences to build a supportive 
                     environment. My time at Amazon taught me to balance analytical rigor with a collaborative mindset,an approach
                      I’ve carried forward into every subsequent endeavor.
